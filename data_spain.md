## Data resources for Spain

**Note:** most R scripts here, developed to clean and aggregate the raw data, use the [muniSpain R package](https://github.com/franvillamil/muniSpain).

### Civilian victimization during the civil war

#### Galicia

A list of all victims of Francoist repression in Galicia was compiled as part of the [*Nomes e Voces*](http://www.nomesevoces.net/) project, developed by several historical researchers at University of Santiago de Compostela, University of Vigo, and University of La Coruña, led by Lourenzo Fernández Prieto (USC). The raw data (CSV) can be download here: [http://vitimas.nomesevoces.net/](http://vitimas.nomesevoces.net/).

[This R script](https://github.com/franvillamil/franvillamil.github.io/blob/master/R/victims_galicia.R) downloads the raw data and produces a municipality-level count of fatal victims of repression between 1936 and 1942, adapting municipalities to territorial changes between 1930 and 2011 censuses.
