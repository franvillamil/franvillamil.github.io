I'm a PhD candidate in the International Conflict Research group at ETH Zurich. I hold an MA in Comparative and International Studies (2016) from ETH Zurich and a BA in Sociology (2014) from the University of Salamanca.

My current research focuses on the consequences of political violence, with an emphasis on how social dynamics shape preference formation in conflict contexts. More broadly, I'm interested in the way the social context conditions individuals' political behavior and preferences. I use quantitative methods extensively, and rely on a variety of data sources and data collection strategies, including digitization of historical archives, web scraping, and geospatial data.

In my dissertation, I explore the long-term legacies of civil wars for political preferences. Contrary to what has been assumed in previous research, I show that wartime violence only has an enduring impact on preferences and behavior when the local social context surrounding the victims facilitates the creation and transmission of collective memories, and their subsequent translation into political behavior. To test this argument, I assemble new datasets at the level of municipalities for Spain and Guatemala, which rely on a variety of archival and secondary sources and cover multiple political phenomena across several decades. To complement the evidence from these two detailed quantiative case studies, I analyze the implications of the argument on a global sample of ethnic groups that have experienced a civil conflict since 1989.
