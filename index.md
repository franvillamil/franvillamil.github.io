I am postdoctoral researcher at the [Carlos III - Juan March Institute](https://ic3jm.es/) in Madrid. I obtained my PhD from ETH Zurich, where I was part of the [International Conflict Research](https://icr.ethz.ch/) group.

My current research focuses on the consequences of political violence, with an emphasis on how social dynamics shape preference formation as a response to shocks. More broadly, I'm interested in the way the social context conditions individuals' political behavior and preferences. I use quantitative methods extensively, and rely on a variety of data sources and data collection strategies, including digitization of historical archives, web scraping, and geospatial data. Part of my research has been published at the *Journal of Peace Research*, the *Journal of Conflict Resolution*, and *Nationalism and Ethnic Politics*.

<!-- I am Assistant Professor at the Department of Social Sciences at the University Carlos III of Madrid and a research fellow at the [Carlos III - Juan March Institute](https://ic3jm.es/).

My research focuses on the causes and consequences of armed conflict and political violence. In particular, I'm interested in how political violence generates endogenous processes that shape the future trajectory of conflicts, mainly through the effect of violence on civilian preferences. I mainly use quantitative and computational methods, and rely on a variety of data sources and data collection strategies, including digitization of historical archives, web scraping, and geospatial data. My book project investigates the long-term consequences of political violence and develops a new theory on how the legacies of violence on individuals' preferences are conditioned by the local social context. The book project is based on my [dissertation](./dissertation.md), which was awarded the [Juan Linz Prize](http://www.cepc.gob.es/en/research/researchprizes/juanjlinzprize). Part of my research has been published at the *Journal of Peace Research*, the *Journal of Conflict Resolution*, *Conflict Management and Peace Science*, and *Research & Politics*, among others. -->

In the [Data & Code](./data.md) section I share different resources I have developed for [my own work](./research.md) in order to facilitate future empirical research, particularly for historical analyses of [Spain](./data_spain.md).
