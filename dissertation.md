#### Abstract:

> This dissertation examines the long-term consequences of wartime violence against civilians on political preferences.
> Previous research suggests that violence either produces a counter-mobilization against the perpetrator or demobilizes the targeted population.
> However, it is unclear under which conditions each of these two effects prevails.
> In this dissertation I bridge these two arguments and argue that the social context surrounding the victims determines the consequences of violence.
> In particular, the effect of violence depends on the ideological context, defined as the presence of ideologically-aligned social networks at the local level.
> 
> The first empirical part tests this argument in the case of Spain, building a novel dataset using archival data, historical secondary sources, and already existing datasets.
> I analyze the effect of Francoist violence against civilians during the civil war on electoral support for the Left after democracy was restored four decades later.
> I show that wartime victimization is linked to an increase in leftist vote share, but mainly in those municipalities where clandestine, left-leaning political networks were active after the conflict.
> In areas where these networks were not present, violence did not have any meaningful consequences.
> 
> The second empirical part tests the theoretical argument in a very different case, Guatemala.
> I again build a local-level dataset using several data sources and analyze the effects of state-led violence against civilians during the civil war on postwar voting patterns, particularly for the leftist party linked to the former rebels that fought against the right-wing government.
> I find that state-led violence increases electoral support for the former rebels in those municipalities which had been exposed to leftist political mobilization before the war.
> In municipalities without such exposure, state-led violence against civilians does not have any significant effect.
> 
> These analyses offer robust evidence supporting the theoretical argument from two very different contexts, which nonetheless constitute single cases.
> The third part adopts a broader perspective and tests the external validity of the argument, focusing on a global sample of ethnic groups and analyzing the impact of ethnically based violence against civilians.
> On the one hand, I find that previous theories on the consequences of violence are not able to explain the effect of violence on conflict recurrence.
> On the other hand, using survey data from several countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, I show that my argument might be a good explanation for the consequences of violence on political attitudes.
