I am Assistant Professor in the [Department of Social Sciences](https://www.uc3m.es/social-sciences-department/home) at Carlos III University in Madrid and a research fellow at the [Carlos III - Juan March Institute](https://ic3jm.es/).

My research focuses on political violence. In particular, I am interested in the aftermath of violent conflicts. My book project investigates the long-term consequences of political violence and develops a new theory on how the legacies of violence persist or get lost over time. Part of my research has been published or conditionally accepted at *The Journal of Politics*, the *Journal of Peace Research*, and the *Journal of Conflict Resolution*, among others.

I obtained my PhD from ETH Zurich in 2020, where I was part of the [International Conflict Research](https://icr.ethz.ch/) group.
