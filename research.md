## Research

### Dissertation / book project

In my dissertation, I explore the long-term legacies of civil wars for political preferences. Contrary to what has been assumed in previous research, I show that wartime violence only has an enduring impact on preferences and behavior when the local social context surrounding the victims facilitates the creation and transmission of memories and their translation into political behavior. To test this argument, I assemble new datasets at the level of municipalities for Spain and Guatemala, which rely on a variety of archival and secondary sources and cover multiple political phenomena across several decades. To complement the evidence from these two detailed quantiative case studies, I analyze the implications of the argument on a global sample of ethnic groups that have experienced a civil conflict since 1989.

> Recent research has focused on the legacies of civil war violence on political preferences, finding that wartime victimization decreases support for the perpetrator or its political identity in the long run. However, we know little about the conditions under which this effect takes place. Historical accounts from civil wars suggest that the long-term effect of violence is not homogenous, nor consistent across areas within a single conflict. Addressing this gap, this article explores the effects of wartime victimization on long-term political preferences at the local level, looking at the conditioning effect of the local social context. In particular, I argue that the effect of wartime violence depends on the existence of local networks that create and maintain memories of the violence, and capitalize on them for future mobilization. This argument is tested in the context of the Spanish Civil War. I build a novel dataset using archival data, historical secondary sources, and already existing datasets, covering 2,100 municipalities across Spain. In line with the argument, it is found that Francoist wartime victimization during the civil war is linked to an increase in leftist vote share after democracy was restored four decades later, but only or mainly in those municipalities where clandestine, left-leaning political networks were active after the conflict.

#### Civilian victimization and ethnic civil war.

With Lars-Erik Cederman, Simon Hug, and Livia Schubiger. Under review.

> While many studies provide insights into the causes of wartime civilian victimization, we know little about how the targeting of particular segments of the civilian population affects the onset and escalation of armed conflict. Previous research on conflict onset has been largely limited to structural variables, both theoretically and empirically. Moving beyond these static approaches, this paper assesses how the state-led targeting of specific ethnic groups affects the likelihood of ethnic conflict onset, and the evolution of conflicts once they break out. Relying on a new dataset with global coverage that captures the ethnic identity of civilian victims of targeted violence, we find evidence that the state-led civilian victimization of particular ethnic groups increases the likelihood that the latter become involved in ethnic civil war. We also find tentative, yet more nuanced, evidence that ethnic targeting by state forces affects the escalation of ongoing conflicts.
