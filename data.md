## Data and resources

### Code

#### R package: Territorial changes in Spanish municipalities

The R package [`muniSpain`](https://github.com/franvillamil/munispain) is designed to deal with territorial changes in Spanish municipalities when working with historical local-level data from different periods.
It relies on the municipality codes from the [*Instituto Nacional de Estadística* (INE)](http://ine.es/) and the list of municipality changes compiled and corrected by Francisco J. Goerlich and Francisco Ruiz (see [Goerlich and Ruiz 2018](https://doi.org/10.1515/jos-2018-0005) and the package readme file for more information).
The package also allows converting municipality names (including old and multi-language denominations) to INE codes.
More information and installation on the [Github repository](https://github.com/franvillamil/munispain).

#### Scraping census data from INE

### Data

[**Data resources for Spain**](./data_spain.md)

Here I offer details, R scripts and raw data for the data I have used in my research.
It includes, among others, disaggregated data on civilian victimization during the Spanish Civil War, presence of trade unions in the 1930s or prewar electoral results.
